    "description": "=======\nCHANGES\n=======\n\n1.0.0 (2013-03-06)\n------------------\n\n- Initial PyPI release.\n\n\n========\nRandom 2\n========\n\nThis package provides a Python 3 ported version of Python 2.7's ``random``\nmodule. It has also been back-ported to work in Python 2.6.\n\nIn Python 3, the implementation of ``randrange()`` was changed, so that even\nwith the same seed you get different sequences in Python 2 and 3. Note that\nseveral high-level functions such as ``randint()`` and ``choice()`` use\n``randrange()``.\n\nIn my testing code I heavily rely on stable random generator results and it\nmakes porting code to Python 3 a lot harder, if all those tests have to be\nadjusted. This package fixes that.",
